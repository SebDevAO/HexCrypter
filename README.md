<div align="center"><strong>⚠️DO NOT UPLOAD ON VIRUSTOTAL OTHERWISE IT WILL NOT BE FUD⚠️</strong></div>

Hex Crypter is designed to be a fully undetectable (FUD) crypter that bypasses all antivirus software. I regularly update the stub to ensure it remains FUD, and in return for my effort, I kindly ask that you do not upload it to VirusTotal. Let's work together to maintain the only FUD crypter on GitHub.

<details>
<summary><b>Backstory</b></summary>
Originally developed for personal use, I've simplified Hex Crypter to make it accessible to everyone. It's easy to use and comes pre-compiled. While primarily designed for Windows, I plan to release the source code and make modifications for Linux users (note: it currently doesn't work with Wine).
